        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup heavy cream or milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of your favorite shredded cheese</li>
            <li>garlic salt and black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 1:</strong> Crack all the eggs into a
            cold pot, add the heavy cream, butter, and beat lightly. We want the eggs to be nicely
            incorporated but without overly aerating the mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 2:</strong> Place the pan over low-medium heat. Using a spatula, scramble
                the mixture making sure to lift any egg that has set on the bottom of the pot. Continue 
                this process every 30 seconds to a minute until the scrambled eggs start to take a
                slightly firm consistency. If the eggs begin to set too quickly, feel free to move the
                pot off of the heat and continue stirring.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the scrambled eggs have started to set, add all of the
                cheese into the pot. Continue to stir the eggs until it is <em>slightly</em> below the 
                desired consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 4:</strong> Add the garlic salt and black pepper to desired taste and
                immediately remove from heat. Transfer all the eggs into a serving bowl and let sit for 
                3-5 minutes. If timed properly, the residual heat will finish cooking the eggs in the bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 5:</strong> Serve and enjoy!
