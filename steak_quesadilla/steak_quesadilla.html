            <li>
                <strong>Step 1:</strong> Prepare the steak by thoroughly drying off with paper towels. 
                Season generously and let dry brine for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. Once marinated,
                cook steak to preferred doneness and set aside to rest. After at least 5 minutes, slice steak 
                into bite sized pieces. Be sure to cut with the grain to preserve tenderness.

                <strong>Step 2:</strong> In a separate pan over medium heat, add a little oil, the bottom
                tortilla, and the mexican blend cheese. Once the cheese begins to melt in the tortilla you 
                may add the diced up steak before assembling with the top tortilla.

            <li>
                <strong>Step 3:</strong> Flip the tortilla every 60-90 seconds until both sides of the 
                quesadilla reach the preferred crispyness. Remove from heat and let rest.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 4:</strong> Serve alongside some fresh guac or salsa and enjoy!
